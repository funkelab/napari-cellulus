### Introduction

Cellulus is a deep learning based method which can be used to obtain instance-segmentation of objects in microscopy images in an unsupervised fashion i.e. requiring no ground truth labels during training.

The main source repository lives [here](https://github.com/funkelab/cellulus).

### Installation

To install the latest development version :

```
pip install git+https://github.com/funkelab/napari-cellulus.git
```
